# PocketBeane — Active Backlog

Last updated: 2026-06-30 (MLB-01 polish complete — UAT fixes, home page overhaul, Y-05 is next)

Items are grouped by dependency tier. Within each tier, order reflects rough priority / logical sequencing.

---

## DECISION — Side project vs. commercial product (June 2026)

After cross-referencing the PMF backlog against the codebase, we split the PMF
gap tickets into two buckets:

**Build — makes the product genuinely better:**
~~PMF-01~~ ✅ (rate limiting), ~~PMF-02~~ ✅ (philosophy quiz UX), ~~PMF-04~~ ✅ (shareable recap
card), PMF-08 (data refresh). These improve the actual draft/season experience
regardless of whether PocketBeane ever has other users.

**Defer — commercial theater for a side project:**
PMF-03 (freemium tier architecture), PMF-05 (email capture), PMF-07 (analytics),
PMF-09 ($4.99 trial tier). These only make sense with a real user base and
billing infrastructure. Building them now adds complexity that makes the tool
worse to use personally. The PMF simulation + product architecture already tell
the portfolio story without a fake paywall.

Yahoo roadmap: Y-02 ✅ → Y-04 ✅ → Y-03 (August build / September validate) → **Y-05 (active next)**.
Note: Y-03 requires a live Yahoo draft for end-to-end validation so infrastructure ships in August. Y-05 is fully unblocked — start with waiver wire advisor + head-to-head matchup advisor, then trade analyzer as a separate sprint.

Multi-sport: MLB-01 ✅ → NHL-01 (August data) → NFL-01 (August data).

---

## Tier 1 — Yahoo-connected features

### ~~Y-02 · League Selection After Auth~~ ✅ DONE
Setup page fetches `/api/yahoo/my-leagues`, renders dropdown, maps selection
to `yahooLeagueKey` on the league config. Home page has auto-match logic for
existing leagues. Full Y-02 spec covered.

---

### ~~Y-06 · Draft History Recap Page~~ ✅ DONE
`DraftComplete.jsx` renders full roster table (round-by-round picks with prior
season stats), category report with grade bars, and Beane's Season Outlook
(Claude-generated strengths / vulnerabilities / narrative). Triggered
automatically when draft is synced from Yahoo.

---

### Y-03 · Live Draft Sync via Polling
**Goal:** During a live Yahoo draft, PocketBeane auto-detects new picks and
updates the board without manual input.

**Approach:** Poll Yahoo's draft picks endpoint every 8–10 seconds during an
active draft session. Diff against local pick state. Apply new picks
automatically. Manual input remains as fallback.

**Prerequisite:** Y-01 ✓, Y-02 ✓

**Note:** Yahoo does not offer WebSocket or webhook events for draft picks.
Polling is the correct approach.

**Timing constraint:** Infrastructure can be built any time, but end-to-end
validation requires a live Yahoo draft in progress. Target build: August 2026,
validate during September draft window.

---

### ~~Y-04 · Post-Draft Roster Sync~~ ✅ DONE
`/api/yahoo/sync-rosters` fetches all 10 team rosters + standings in parallel,
matches players to `players.json` IDs by name normalization, stores result as
`league.leagueRosters` in Zustand. Season Hub shows standings table with
expandable team rosters; user's team auto-expands and is highlighted. Refresh
button for in-season updates.

---

### Y-05 · Season Management Suite ← NEXT
**Goal:** Full in-season advisor powered by live Yahoo data.

**Sub-features (ship in this order):**

| Sub-feature | Priority | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Waiver wire advisor | 1st | Recommend adds/drops based on roster gaps, schedule density, recent trend |
| Head-to-head matchup advisor | 2nd | Weekly outlook vs. current opponent — category projections and lineup suggestions |
| Start/sit advisor | 3rd | Optimal weekly lineup given schedule, matchup, recent form, injury status |
| Trade analyzer | 4th (own sprint) | Input give/receive — Claude evaluates net category impact, positional balance, buy-low/sell-high signal |
| Trade value index | 5th | Running power ranking of roster trade value — who to sell high, buy low, or hold |
| League pulse | 6th | Weekly league-wide summary — who's dominating, who's weak, who might be open to trading |

**Foundation already in place:**
- `league.leagueRosters` (from Y-04) provides full team rosters + standings for all 10 teams
- Season Hub auto-syncs on mount if data is >7 days stale (built during MLB-01 UAT sprint)
- `sport` field on `leagueConfig` is threaded through all API calls — Y-05 will be sport-agnostic from day one

**Prerequisite:** Y-01 ✓, Y-02 ✓, Y-04 ✓

---

## Tier 2 — Speculative / Needs investigation

### P-01 · Premium Refresh Gate (Monetization)
**Goal:** Gate "Get Beane's Insights" manual refreshes behind a paid tier once billing infrastructure exists.

**Current state:** Free tier has a 5-refresh-per-draft budget (implemented). Counter is visible in the UI. When exhausted, button is disabled with "No refreshes remaining."

**Premium version:** Replace the disabled state with an upgrade CTA modal. Unlimited manual refreshes as a Pro feature. Budget constant (`REFRESH_BUDGET`) lives in `RecommendationPanel.jsx` — easy to raise or remove per tier.

**Prerequisite:** Billing/subscription layer (Stripe or similar). Do not build until payment infra is in place.

---

### S-01 · AI Autopick (Premium Feature Candidate)
**Goal:** When connected to an active Yahoo draft, PocketBeane selects the pick automatically based on the configured strategy.

**Status: BLOCKED — needs API research.** Yahoo's Fantasy Sports API is largely read-only. The ability to make a programmatic draft pick via the API is unconfirmed. Do not build toward this until API capability is verified.

**If feasible:** This is a premium/opt-in feature. User explicitly enables autopick mode per draft. Strategy is sourced from B-01 philosophy settings.

---

## Multi-Sport Expansion

All sport expansions require a `{sport}_players.json` file with ADP rankings and prior season stats before recommendation logic can be calibrated. The `sports.js` config already has stub entries for NHL, NFL, and MLB — the architecture is sport-config driven and ready. The Yahoo OAuth layer supports all three sports via `game_codes={sport}`.

---

### ~~MLB-01 · MLB League Support~~ ✅ DONE
Full MLB 5×5 draft experience shipped 2026-06-27. Multi-sport architecture generalized across the entire codebase — `lowerIsBetter` config field drives ERA/WHIP grading correctly; `filterPositions` drives scarcity engine; `game_codes=mlb` wired into roster sync. `mlb_players.json` built from FantasyPros 2026 ADP + Baseball Reference 2025 stats via `scripts/build-mlb-players.js` — 300 players (181 hitters, 119 pitchers), 28 rookies/injured included with `prior_season: null` so they appear on board by ADP.

---

### NHL-01 · NHL League Support
**Status: Blocked on data — nhl_players.json needed (August 2026)**

**Goal:** Full NHL draft experience using the existing sports.js stub as the foundation.

**Complexity note:** Goalies and skaters have completely separate stat profiles. The category grading engine will need to handle `sv_pct` as a percentage category and `gaa` as a lower-is-better category. The `G` position (goalie) has no overlap with skater positions — slot logic must treat them as distinct pools.

**What's needed:**
- `nhl_players.json` — skaters + goalies, 2026-27 projected ADP + 2025-26 prior season stats
  - Source: FantasyPros NHL ADP (August), Hockey Reference (per-game stats)
- `sports.js` NHL config entry (stub already commented in):
  - `filterPositions: ['C', 'LW', 'RW', 'W', 'D', 'G']`
  - Skater categories: `G`, `A`, `+/-`, `PIM`, `PPP`, `SHP`, `SOG`
  - Goalie categories: `W`, `GAA`, `SV%`, `SO`
  - `percentageCategories: ['sv_pct']`
  - `lowerIsBetter: ['gaa']`
- Claude prompt tuning for NHL context (goalie streaming, early-season regression, etc.)
- `sync-rosters.js` game_codes=nhl variant

**Testing constraint:** No completed NHL league available. End-to-end validation requires a test draft or an active league. October 2026 season start = first real test window.

**Timing:** Data available August 2026. Build alongside PMF-08 data refresh sprint.

---

### NFL-01 · NFL League Support
**Status: Blocked on data — nfl_players.json needed (August 2026)**

**Goal:** Full NFL draft experience — same structure as NHL, same timeline.

**Complexity note:** NFL has the most position heterogeneity of any sport. QB is a completely separate stat pool (passing yards, TDs, INTs, rushing). K and DST are streaming positions that change weekly. Bye weeks add lineup complexity that doesn't exist in NBA/NHL. Standard scoring vs. PPR vs. half-PPR creates divergent ADP curves — need to decide which format to target first (PPR is the most common).

**What's needed:**
- `nfl_players.json` — ~200 relevant skill-position players, PPR ADP + 2025 season stats
  - Source: FantasyPros NFL ADP (August), Pro Football Reference
- `sports.js` NFL config entry (stub already commented in):
  - `filterPositions: ['QB', 'RB', 'WR', 'TE', 'K', 'DEF', 'FLEX', 'BN']`
  - Scoring format: PPR (first pass), with `scoringFormat` config supporting `ppr | half_ppr | standard`
  - Point categories (NFL is typically points-based, not category): `pts`, `passYds`, `rushYds`, `recYds`, `passTDs`, `rushRecTDs`
- Claude prompt tuning for NFL draft strategy (Zero RB, Hero RB, Robust RB, TE-premium)
- `sync-rosters.js` game_codes=nfl variant

**Testing constraint:** No completed NFL league available. September 2026 draft window is the first test opportunity.

**Timing:** Data available August 2026. Build alongside PMF-08 and NHL-01 data sprint.

## Platform & Design

---

### D-01 · Full App UI Revamp
**Status: No external dependency — can start any time; research component required**

**Goal:** Overhaul the visual identity of PocketBeane from the current monochrome Tailwind default into a polished, premium sports analytics product.

**Current state:** Dark background + single green accent (`#22c55e`, Tailwind `green-500`), monospace typography for data labels, no imagery, no logo beyond the wordmark. Functional but not visually distinctive.

**What this covers:**

| Area | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Color palette | Single green on dark | Proper design system — primary, accent, muted, destructive tokens |
| Imagery | None | Player silhouettes, sport-specific backgrounds, hero moments |
| Typography | System font + mono for data | Sports-appropriate type scale — distinct heading vs. data vs. body |
| Logo/wordmark | Plain text "PocketBeane" | Refined mark with optional icon |
| Card system | Uniform surface/border pattern | Differentiated cards for draft board, recommendation panel, DNA card |
| Mobile | Responsive but unstyled | Intentionally mobile-first layouts for Season Hub and Draft DNA share card |

**Research component (do this first):**
Before touching code, define the visual direction:
- Reference apps: The Athletic, ESPN Fantasy, Stathead, Underdog Fantasy, Sleeper
- Decide: sports-data minimal (high info density, monochrome) vs. brand-forward (team colors, hero imagery) vs. premium analytics (dark glass, gradient accents)
- Mood board → token decisions → then code

**Acceptance criteria:**
- New color token system defined and applied globally (Tailwind config updated)
- At least one imagery element on the home/draft screen
- Draft DNA card looks polished enough to share publicly
- Typography hierarchy is clear across all major screens
- Passes a11y contrast check on all primary text

**Note:** This should happen before any public-facing launch or sharing push. The Draft DNA share card in particular will represent the app to anyone outside who receives it.

| Yahoo API data layer | Done — `/api/yahoo/league.js` + `/api/yahoo/league-full.js`; fetches settings, standings, rosters, full 156-pick draft board from TriStar Reboot (466.l.22207) |
| Y-02 · League Selection After Auth | Done — setup page dropdown + home page auto-match via `/api/yahoo/my-leagues` |
| Y-06 · Draft History Recap Page | Done — `DraftComplete.jsx`: roster table, category report, Beane's Season Outlook |
| Y-07 · League Context in AI Recommendations | Done — `/api/yahoo/settings.js` endpoint; "Sync from Yahoo" in setup page; statCategories + rosterPositions threaded into Claude prompt; hardcoded 9-cat string replaced with dynamic scoring line |
| PMF-01 · Rate Limiting on /api/recommend | Done — 50 calls/session cap, X-Session-Id header, HTTP 429 on breach |
| PMF-02 · Philosophy First-Visit Onboarding Quiz | Done — PhilosophyQuiz overlay, GM Profile page, per-league overrides, profile injected into all Claude calls. Quiz vocabulary aligned with league setup fields (conservative/moderate/aggressive, beane/balanced/stars-and-scrubs/punt). New league setup seeds philosophy from completed profile. |
| PMF-04 · Draft DNA System | Done — Spotify Wrapped-style archetype identity system. 9 archetypes (Moneyball GM → Contrarian catch-all) classified from ADP deltas, category grades, and GM profile. DraftDNACard modal auto-shows on first draft completion; re-openable via button below Category Report. Bold prediction via Haiku API, cached in league state. Web Share API primary; clipboard fallback with "Copied!" state. DraftRecap.jsx replaces DraftComplete.jsx. |
| PMF-04 UAT polish (2026-06-27) | Setup page: Yahoo Sync reordered before League Name; already-synced Yahoo leagues disabled in dropdown. DraftDNACard: share redesigned to Web Share API only (no hardcoded social buttons). Category Report reverted to original bar-chart. Moneyball GM threshold raised 3→4 value picks. classifyDraftDNA emits console.debug for every archetype evaluated. Archetype distribution silently tracked in localStorage key pocketbeane_archetype_stats. |
| Y-04 · Post-Draft Roster Sync | Done — `/api/yahoo/sync-rosters` fetches all team rosters + standings in parallel, name-matches to players.json IDs, stored as league.leagueRosters. Season Hub rebuilt: standings table with expandable rosters, user's team highlighted and auto-expanded, Refresh button for in-season updates. |
| MLB-01 · MLB League Support | Done — full 5×5 draft + recommendations + Draft DNA + Season Hub sync. `lowerIsBetter` config field, sport-aware scarcity, 300-player `mlb_players.json` (FantasyPros 2026 ADP + BBRef 2025 stats). `build-mlb-players.js` script for future data refreshes. |
| MLB-01 UAT fixes + polish (2026-06-29) | `sync-draft.js` was hardcoded to NBA — fixed with `?sport=` param, `mlb_players.json`, `game_codes=mlb`. IL `SlotCountRow` max raised from 3→6 so value=4 renders correctly. `importDraft` now sets `status: 'season'` (was `'complete'`); Zustand migration v0→v1 converts existing affected leagues on first load. Setup page: sport selector moved above Yahoo Sync and filters the dropdown by sport. `yahooSeason` threaded from my-leagues response → league config for year-based archive grouping. Season Hub: standings table removed; weekly auto-sync on mount (stale after 7 days). Home page: leagues grouped by sport with section headers; archive/restore system (manual archive for `season` leagues; NBA auto-archives after 7 days inactive; restore button on archived leagues; archived grouped by year within sport). Draft DNA: `getFallbackPrediction(archetypeId, sport)` with MLB month-aware overrides; `lowGpPicks` uses `injury_risk` flag for MLB instead of gp count; `gpFloorThreshold` 70→20 for MLB; Moneyball GM threshold raised 4→5. `recommend.js`: `buildAdviceSystem(sport)` and `buildAuctionWatchingSystem(sport)` replace static constants with MLB-specific style examples. |

## PMF Gap Tickets — Active (makes the product better)
*Added June 2026 — derived from cross-referencing PMF simulation tickets against the shipped codebase.*
*Source document: POCKETBEANE_PMF_BACKLOG.md*
*See DECISION note at top of file for why commercial tickets are deferred.*

Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL (pre-September) · 🟡 HIGH · 🟢 SEASON

---

### PMF-08 · August 2026 ADP/Stats Data Refresh 🔴
**PMF source:** Open question #3 in PMF backlog; open item in BACKLOG.md

`players.json` contains pre-2026-27 season data (2025-26 prior season stats, 2025-26 ADP). The September draft requires 2026-27 projections and fresh ADP rankings. Without this, all recommendation logic is calibrated to stale data.

**What to build:**
- Run `scripts/build-players.js` with fresh source files:
  - Export 2026 ADP data from FantasyPros (download as CSV in late August)
  - Export 2025-26 per-game stats from Basketball Reference (CSV export)
- Resolve name mismatches in `review.json` (output of build script)
- Update `auction_value` field for all players (auction leagues)
- Verify top 50 manually against expert consensus
- Refresh injury notes and `injury_status` fields

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `players.json` sorted by 2026-27 ADP
- Prior season stats reflect 2025-26 actuals
- `review.json` is empty (all players matched)
- Top 50 ADP spot-checked against FantasyPros consensus

**Timing:** Complete by August 28, 2026 (two weeks before typical Yahoo draft windows open).

---

## PMF Gap Tickets — Deferred (commercial product only)
*These tickets only make sense with a real user base and billing infrastructure.*
*Do not build until PocketBeane has users beyond the owner. The PMF simulation*
*and existing architecture already tell the portfolio story without these.*
*Revisit if the project goes commercial.*

---

### PMF-03 · Freemium Tier Architecture
**PMF source:** C3 (paywall moment redesign — CRITICAL for commercial launch)
**Deferred reason:** Fake paywall adds codebase complexity with no personal-use benefit.

No tier system exists. P-01 only gates the 5-refresh budget with a disabled button. The simulation validated a specific paywall architecture: feature-gating at the category gap analysis step, not an arbitrary round cutoff. The tier comparison screen must be shown before the draft starts.

**What to build:**

Free tier (Scout):
- Full draft board, player pool, ADP sorting
- Basic recommendation: Steps 1–2 only (board assessment + value identification)
- Draft board marking (available / user pick / opponent pick)
- Watermarked draft recap ("Upgrade to see your full draft grade")
- No category gap analysis, no positional scarcity engine, no synthesis (Steps 3–5)

Paid tier (GM — $19/season):
- Full 5-step recommendation engine
- Category gap analysis (Step 3)
- Positional scarcity engine (Step 4)
- Full recommendation synthesis with rationale (Step 5)
- Season management suite
- Draft recap with full category grade
- Multi-league support (up to 3 leagues)

Paywall trigger: when a free user's recommendation would include Steps 3–5, show inline locked state — "Category gap analysis is a GM-tier feature. [Upgrade to GM — $19/season]"

**Files affected:**
- New: `src/components/PaywallPrompt.jsx` — inline locked state component
- New: `src/components/TierComparison.jsx` — pre-draft tier explainer
- Modified: `src/store/leagueStore.js` — add `userTier: 'scout' | 'gm'` to state
- Modified: `pages/api/recommend.js` — accept and enforce `userTier` in request body; return partial steps for Scout
- Modified: `pages/draft.jsx` — show tier comparison in onboarding; gate recommendation steps by tier
- Modified: `src/components/draft/DraftComplete.jsx` — watermark recap for Scout tier

**Prerequisite:** Billing/subscription layer (Stripe) needed before `userTier` is production-enforced.

---

### PMF-05 · Email Capture + Resend Integration
**PMF source:** C5 (missing email capture = no re-engagement channel between drafts)
**Deferred reason:** No users to email. Revisit if the project goes commercial.

---

### PMF-06 · Post-Draft Season Onboarding Bridge 🟢
**PMF source:** S1 (post-draft dropout is a major churn driver)
**Deferred reason:** Season management suite (Y-05) must exist first for this bridge to lead anywhere meaningful.

---

### PMF-07 · Basic Analytics Foundation
**PMF source:** Finding 5 (distribution is the unsolved problem)
**Deferred reason:** You are the only user — you already know how you're using it. Revisit if the project goes commercial.

---

### PMF-09 · $4.99 Trial Tier Implementation
**PMF source:** Finding 7 ($4.99 trial tier validated — 38% of trial users upgraded to annual)
**Deferred reason:** Requires PMF-03 + Stripe + real users. Revisit if the project goes commercial.

**Prerequisite:** PMF-03 (Freemium Tier Architecture) + Stripe account setup
